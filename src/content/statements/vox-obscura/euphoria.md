You've been here before when everything you've loved walked out the door. There's nothing left here for you anymore other than to feel alive and chase an impossible high. Soon, you start forgetting who you are, but you find solace in the suffering. Now only your vices remain as you and your partner seek a little more apathy through the pain. Some days just feel like they never existed.
