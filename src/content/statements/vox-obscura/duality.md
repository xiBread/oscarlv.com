Strangers conversing in the long identical hallways. The soulless abstract art adorning the walls. Warm city lights peering in from the window, six stories off the ground. Hotel rooms exist as a state suspended halfway between occupied and vacant. Your existence in this temporary space relieves you from the routine of lifeâ€”chores, family, work, and other mundane distractions: no past but an infinite present.
