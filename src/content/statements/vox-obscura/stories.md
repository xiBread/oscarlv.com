The familiar sound of a bell rings as you open the door. The scent of old books infused with the passage of time invades your senses. You start wandering down every aisle, running your finger across every book, searching for your next fantasy to immerse yourself in. Towers of bound paper await you. If only you had enough time to read every story in the world.
