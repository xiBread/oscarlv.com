The day is done and you're just looking for somewhere to unwind and recharge. Home is too familiar and has lost its novelty, so you decide to try that new coffee shop downtown. You're greeted by the rich aroma of freshly ground coffee beans and warm wooden accents. You settle into a cushioned niche by the window and watch the world go by. It's a simple moment that many others would find mundane, but it fills you with subtle joy, and that's enough.
