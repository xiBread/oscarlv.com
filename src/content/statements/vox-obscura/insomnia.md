A street light's faint, warm glow peers into your small one-bedroom apartment. Your mind lies awake while your eyes try to find momentary peace. But there's a persistent feeling that you can't shake, keeping you from truly resting. You can't help but feel the synonymity of death while lying on your back as you ease your breathing, encased in a box, unsure if you'll ever wake again.
