A blanket of black velvet embellished by millions of sparkling jewels holds your heart. The chilled air runs through your hair as you settle down atop a hill overlooking a sleeping city. Something about the sound of every nocturnal creature awakening comforts you. This is the only time you feel like you can be yourself&mdash;a witness to the profound beauty of the night and the depths of your own contemplation.
