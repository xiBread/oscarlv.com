Amidst your late-night drive, you pass through a threshold where everything is blending together. The road stretches endlessly before you, disappearing into the distance while your car engine idles. There's nothing but faint streaks of red following and a soft, uncanny, yet inviting glow ahead of you. It's as if the world has fallen asleep, and you are now the sole traveler on a journey through the unknown.
