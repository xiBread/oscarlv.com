*Inspired by [anoscetia](https://vox-obscura.vercel.app/the-interior-wilderness/anoscetia) and [the whipgraft delusion](https://vox-obscura.vercel.app/the-interior-wilderness/the-whipgraft-delusion).*

You catch a reflection of yourself in the glass as you walk by, but something's off. You stop to examine the stranger on the other side. Is this really you? Do you *really* know who you are? You step into a crisis of cascading self-doubt and start questioning everything that has brought you to this point. The space between knowing yourself and *knowing* yourself has never felt larger.
