There is a phenomenon that occurs when experiencing the loss of someone, whether it be physically or mentally. You start convincing yourself that they'll come back, that it's only temporary. Time blends together, and then, as the dust settles, you finally realize you've wasted an eternity waiting for someone who will never return. No matter how hard you beg or plead, they are gone.
