Hundreds of square feet populated with nothing but the echo of your footsteps on the tile floors, bouncing off the blank walls. A peculiar wistfulness accompanies this vacancy&mdash;one that evokes a sense of wonder about what this place was like in its prime. Now, all that's left are the remnants of a once bustling expanse, reverted to its primitive form of transition, waiting, and the unknown.
