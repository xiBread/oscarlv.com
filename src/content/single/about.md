I'm an autodidact software developer who enjoys expressing creativity through pictures and words.

I've always been obsessed with how things work. Logic is heavily objective, so naturally I strayed towards subjects like math and science in school. This led me to discover my passion in programming. Being able to understand how technology functions *and* work with numbers? It's the best of both worlds. That's when I decided to embark on my journey of coding and creation.

Beyond the lines of code, my creative spirit finds solace in photography and writing. I specialize in fine-art photography, allowing me to capture a wide variety of ideas and emotions. I find this art form satisfying because of how much manipulation can be done to the subject in order to get the perfect end result.

My writing draws from personal experiences, dreams of my future, and what I wish I could've done differently. I focus my attention to contemporary poetry and dialogue but have capabilities in short stories and fantasies.
