Inspired by [*The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows*](https://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/), *Vox Obscura* explores the internal unknowns; sentiments that are universally held but only operate in the background of our lives. The title is Latin for "a dark voice"; however, it can also be interpreted as "a shadowy voice."

Each piece represents a word (or multiple) from the dictionary and is accompanied by a small passage (click on a photo) describing the scene to allow picturing yourself in that moment.
