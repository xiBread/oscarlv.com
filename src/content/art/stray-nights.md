*Stray Nights* is aptly named after [a song with the same name](https://open.spotify.com/track/0oE1bkIrcep7JnLLdxSsMw?si=4e4abb1ae3604574) by [Stephen](https://open.spotify.com/artist/64N1HzkQEXvjlJBQinWeu2?si=EOiQ2LlxTRiIfuSkLku7pQ). The song focuses on anonymity and acceptance of being in the moment. I took this idea and merged it with with my own experiences, seeking to capture the essence of those spontaneous, unscripted nights that lead us down unexpected paths.

The main feature of this collection is the grunge aesthetic, including grain, blur, flash, and glare. All of these effects contribute to the raw and immersive atmosphere, analagous to when we let go of expectations and simply allow life to happen.
