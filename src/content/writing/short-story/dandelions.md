As the engine shut off, he groaned, "Do I really have to be here?"

"No, but I know you have nothing else to do," she replied.

"Well, okay, yes, but couldn't you just get someone else that has nothing else to do?"

"Like who? You know you're the only one I talk to."

"Where even are we?" he asked as he swiveled his head, scanning his surroundings. "There's nothing around here except grass and flowers. Wait a minute… oh god, you're planning to murder me, aren't you?" His sarcastic tone started to annoy her. "This is because of the time I spilled milk in your car, isn't it? I knew it! What gave it away? Did the seat—"

"Wait, you spilled milk in my car? When?"

He stayed silent, realizing he just admitted to something that she wouldn't have known otherwise. "You didn't know?"

"No… You must've cleaned it enough. And calm down, I'm not gonna murder you. We're just here to pick flowers."

"Oh. Well, why didn't you say so?"

"I was going to before you started spewing nonsense," she said as she exited her car. "Well? What are you doing? Get out." She walked to the back and opened the trunk, revealing two empty woven baskets. "Here, take this."

"What's this for?"

"For the flowers dumbass."

"Oh, right. Sooo what flowers are we picking out?"

"Any. Just make sure to get an assortment of colors. Oh, and pick up any dandelions you find."

"Why dandelions?"

"Just do it."

"Okay, boss." They started walking toward the field of flowers. "What are we going to use these for?"

"I'm going to make a bouquet out of them."

"For who?"

"You ask too many questions."

"Hey, you're the one who brought me along."

"Yeah, and I'm starting to regret that decision."

"So? What's the occasion? Anniversary? Who's the lucky guy?"

She sighed. "You really want to know?"

"I wouldn't be asking if I didn't."

"Anniversary. A death anniversary," she reluctantly answered.

"Oh. Relative?"

"No, friend."

"Mutual?"

"No." Her responses were short and cold, hinting at him to stay quiet. He took it, and they picked in silence. Eventually, she broke it.

"I'm surprised you haven't asked more questions."

"I got the feeling you wanted me to shut up."

"You're right, but I also don't like this silent tension."

"Well, what were they like?"

"He was quiet. Shy. But he had a good heart. Not a lot of people saw that in him. His parents divorced in high school because his mom was a drug addict, and his dad neglected him, which caused a lot of the other kids to bully him. His mom died later the same year from overdosing. I had no idea what was happening in his life at the time, but I could tell he was depressed because although he was reserved, he still made attempts to socialize, and that all came to a sudden stop. I became the only person that was there for him during his grief. One day after school, he asked if I wanted to come help pick out flowers for his mom's grave. Obviously, I went. I noticed he only had dandelions in his hand when we were done. I asked why. He said they were his mom's favorite and became his too."

"How'd they pass?"

"He, um…" She froze. "He killed himself."

"Oh… I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked that."

"No, it's okay… I only found out because he had me down as his emergency contact, which I didn't even know until the medics called me." She stared at the ground in silence, holding her basket in front of her. He walked up next to her and put his hand on her shoulder.

"Every year, on his birthday, I pick flowers and make a bouquet to put on his grave. I usually do it alone, but this year I just felt like I needed someone with me." She cleared her throat as it started to break and rubbed away the tears forming in her eyes. "So, thank you for coming along."

"Dude, of course." He set down his basket to hug her. "I'll come with you every year if you want."

"I'd like that," she whispered as she smiled.
