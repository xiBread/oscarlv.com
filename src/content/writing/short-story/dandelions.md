Spring is in full bloom, and the scent of wildflowers lingered, mingling with the promise of new beginnings. The air had a crisp yet subtle breeze. It was on days like these where she felt that the world was in harmony again. It was only appropriate to drive her dad's '67 Mustang. He was always reluctant to let her drive it because of its value and his personal attachment to it, but he also wanted to share the experience of driving something with history instead of a lifeless metal box.

"This is the car I picked up your mother in for our first date," he always told her. "Maybe one day you'll pick up your future husband in it," he jokingly remarked as he handed her the keys.

"Yeah, maybe," she replied.

"Drive safe, bug."

"I will!" she exclaimed as she walked out the door. Her friend was already waiting outside, leaning against the hood of the car.

"You ready?" he asked.

"Yeah, let's go."

The sun's rays filtered through the towering pines, casting dappled patterns on the asphalt. The car traveled onward, its engine humming in the background of an amicable argument.

"I just don't understand why it's a stigma. How is it any different than tomato or pepperoni or mushroom?"

"It's an insult to all things Italian, that's why."

"You're not even Italian."

"So? I can still defend the culture. You can't just defile a classic like that."

"Defile? Dude, it's not like I'm trying to remove the cheese from pizza here, I'm just advocating for more variety."

"Pizza already has enough variety with the toppings we have. Pineapple just throws the whole flavor profile off."

The car emerged from the forest onto a dirt road surrounded by a field of vibrant green grass.

"See, that's where you're wrong." she continued. "It adds an unexpected tropical zing. It's like a free Hawaiian vacation in your mouth."

"A vacation my mouth would rather not take."

She rolled her eyes as she slowed and parked next to the field. "You're so boring."

"I'd rather be boring than ostracized."

"Well, you keep that mindset. I'll die happily knowing I tried everything," she said with a smug smile. She removed the key from the ignition. "We're here, by the way."

As the engine shut off, he groaned, "Do I really have to be here?"

"No, but I know you have nothing else to do," she replied.

"Well, okay, yes, but couldn't you just get someone else that has nothing else to do?"

"Like who? We both know you're the only one who would agree to go on a mini road trip in the middle of a Saturday."

He rubbed the back of his neck in reluctant agreement. "Yeah, I guess so. Where even are we?" he asked as he swiveled his head, scanning his surroundings. "There's nothing around here except grass and flowers. Wait… you're planning to murder me, aren't you?" His sarcastic tone started to annoy her. "This is because of the time I spilled bleach on the seats, isn't it? I knew it! What gave it away? Did the seat—"

"Wait, you spilled bleach?! When?!"

He attempted to keep his expression neutral, but he started laughing after staring at her, knowing full well she was trying to hold back her rage.

"Hello? Like?" She looked at him, confused.

"I'm joking. Calm down."

"You're insufferable sometimes, you know that?"

"I hear it's one of my redeeming qualities, actually. Anyway, let's stop talking about me, are we picking flowers or what?"

"That's what we were going to do before you decided to give me a panic attack," she said as she exited her car. She walked to the back and opened the trunk, revealing two empty woven baskets. "Here, take this."

"What's this for?"

"For the flowers, dumbass," she exasperated.

"Oh, right. Sooo what flowers are we picking out?"

"Any. Just make sure to get an assortment of colors. Oh, and pick up any dandelions you find."

"Why dandelions?"

"Just do it."

"You got it, boss." They started walking into the field. "What are we going to use these for?"

"I'm going to make a bouquet out of them."

"For who?"

"You ask too many questions."

"Hey, you're the one who brought me along."

"Yeah, and I'm starting to regret that decision."

"Aw, you don't mean that. Who else would annoy you like I do?"

"Preferably no one."

There was a moment of playful silence as they continued through the meadow until they reached a patch scattered in a variety of flowers.

"Is he hot at least? Or she. I don't discriminate. More power to you."

"Stop being weird. And that's not why we're here."

"Then?"

She sighed. "You really want to know?"

"I wouldn't be asking if I didn't."

"A death," she reluctantly answered.

"Oh. Relative?"

"No, friend."

"Mutual?"

"No." Her responses were short and cold, hinting at him to stay quiet. He took it, and they picked in silence. She eventually broke it.

"I'm surprised you haven't asked more questions."

"I got the feeling you wanted me not to."

"You're right, but I also don't like this silent tension."

"What do you want me to ask?"

"I don't know, anything."

He clicked his tongue as he tried to think of something non-invasive to ask. "How's your dog doing…?"

"Not those types of questions. I mean, like… you know."

It took him a second to interpret what she was implying, but the soft cadence and subtle movement of her head said it all. She wanted to talk about it. "Well, what were they like?" he asked.

"He was quiet. Shy. But he had a good heart. Not a lot of people saw that in him. His parents divorced in high school because his mom was a drug addict, and his dad neglected him. His mom died later the same year from overdosing. I had no idea what was happening in his life at the time, but I could tell he was depressed. He may have been quiet, but he still made attempts to socialize, and that all came to a sudden stop."

"That's tragic. Did you ever tell anyone?"

"I did, but all they seem to have done was just prescribe him pills. It felt like I was the only person who cared. I didn't really know what to do so I just tried my best to be there when I could." She stared at the dandelions below her in silence. Her grip on her basket tightened.

"I'm assuming dandelions are his favorite?"

"They were his mom's. He asked me after class one day if I wanted to come help pick out flowers for her grave. Obviously, I went. I noticed he only had dandelions in his hand when we were done. I asked why, and he said they were his mom's favorite."

"How'd they pass?"

"He overdosed himself a few months ago."

"Oh… Sorry, I shouldn't have asked that."

She continued to stare blankly at the ground below her. "Tylenol of all things," she scoffed. "I only found out because I was his emergency contact, which I didn't even know until they called. I just feel like I could've done more."

"Hey, you did your best, like you said. There's no doubt that he appreciated everything you did for him."

She crouched down to grab a dandelion. "It's his birthday tomorrow. I wanted to make a bouquet to put on his grave." She cleared her throat as it started to break. "So, thank you… for coming."

"Of course." He sat down his basket to hug her. "I'll do this with you every year if you want."

"I'd like that," she whispered as she smiled.
