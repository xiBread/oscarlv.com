title: Something
excerpt: it was forehead kisses and holding hands.
---

it wasn't love,
but it was something.

maybe we were just two souls
that stared into each other's eyes for too long.
ones who called themselves best friends
when they secretly knew it was way more.

two souls that felt completely content in each other's company.
two people that talked for endless hours.

ones who never got bored of listening and learning.
ones who would show up no matter the time or place.
ones who made each other nervous in the best possible way.

it was church on a Sunday morning,
telling stories to each other about where we were.
it was forehead kisses and holding hands.
ones who read each other's souls like a book.

it wasn't love,
but it was *something*.
