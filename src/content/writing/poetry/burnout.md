People put their love into potential.

Thus, your postponed passion and minimum wage job
won't be enough for their love.
One minute, their sharp tongues carry bitter words
about the children before you.

You decide you will never be like them.

Until, before your eyes they rise from ashes of capability,
who is left but you to scold?
Your very own potential has slipped through your fingers.
Gifts left far from behind.

Now all that you are is all you have been.
That's what they say as you scream out for silence.
If the bickering stopped and you shut the gates,
all that you are is right here within you.
In the silence.

How can I have failed if I haven't even began?

I have not yet failed.
I have not yet even begun.
