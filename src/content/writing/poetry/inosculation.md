Every day, I passed two trees,
Branches interlocked and roots tangled beneath the dirt.
They looked like me and you.
The way they swayed reminds me of a night that our souls flew.
Our hearts and minds entangled in a complex and codependent love.
No sounds of sorrow, just the stars we admired far above.

Every day, I passed two trees,
And one's leaves had lost their color.
The other stood strong, its leaves had not grown duller.
I wonder if they thought about the sadness that may spread.
I wish that I had though you'd catch my sickness far ahead.

Every day, I passed two trees.
The pungent smell filled my nose, its rotting wood.
The branches drooped so low, so sad, so sorry.
We grew so close together that I tainted your sweet smile.
The way you made me feel so seen may not have been worthwhile.

Today, I passed two stumps.
But further down my path, two figures stole my gaze.
Two newly planted trees with space to grow their separate ways.
I sat down not too close, my mind slowly withdrew,
For one last time I thought they looked just like me and you.
