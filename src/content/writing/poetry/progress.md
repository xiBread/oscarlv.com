I am almost certain I will never tell you this.

I am able to meet new people
And flash a smile at them
Or laugh at a joke I hear.
I have learned I can be happy without you.

But somewhere,
In between all those moments,
I find myself longing for you.
My heart still drops.
It is still hard to breathe.

Does my absence ever tug at your heart?
