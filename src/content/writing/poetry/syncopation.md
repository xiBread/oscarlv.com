The most painful love is always untouched.
The unfortunate love in which time never serves opportunity.

For years, we've been dancing out of time;
My legs ache, and my heart begs for rhythm.
Love is not enough on its own,
a painful lesson for which we cannot yet accept.

So we dance through night and day hoping
that eventually
our steps will sync,
and our souls will collide.
