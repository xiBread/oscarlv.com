You made a liar out of me.

I told you I hated onions,
but after learning they're you're favorite,
I added them to my weekly grocery list.

I told you I hated pop music,
but I heard this one song that reminded me of you,
and now I have a playlist full of them.

I told you I had been in love before,
but after falling for you,
I'm not so sure that's true.

I told you I don't give second chances,
but then you hurt me,
and now I give third and fourths.

I told you I don't miss you,
but I lied,
because I really fucking do.
