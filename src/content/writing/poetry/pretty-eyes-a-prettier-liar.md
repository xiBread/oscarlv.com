title: Pretty Eyes, A Prettier Liar
excerpt: The echo of a love I can't quite let go.
---

Pretty eyes, a prettier liar.
That's what they said, anyway.
Warnings whispered on the wind,
Scrawled in the margins of my better judgement.

But those eyes, like pools of melted starlight,
Reflecting back everything I wanted to be,
Everything I thought I was missing.
A kaleidoscope swirling hues of forever and always.

Those eyes still gleam,
But the glow that once led me astray has left me stranded
In the bitter cold of a dying facade,
In the cracks of a hollow smile and a distant touch.

And still, I hesitate to leave,
A moth drawn to a flickering flame,
Knowing it will burn me to ashes,
Because even in the blistering storm,
There's a lingering warmth,
A ghost of the beauty I once believed in,
The echo of a love I can't quite let go.

You have pretty eyes, but you're a prettier liar.
