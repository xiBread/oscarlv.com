title: Alone
---

I used to be scared to be by myself.

I'd sink deeper and deeper
Into my own fabric of reality,
Drowning in the worlds I'd created.
What if I had substituted pride
For forgiveness
At my lowest points?
Would I still have you by my side?

Everyone tells me
That everything happens for a reason,
And that, at a certain point,
We have to relinquish control
To the universe.
And so, I sit there,
Holding back tears.

After all,
If the universe believes this is the best for me,
Then I should accept it
With open arms.
If the universe tells me
To be by myself again,
It must mean that I need to learn to live with myself.

I'll make my bed,
Lay out my clothes,
Brush my teeth,
And look at myself in the mirror
Without hating how I look.
I'll get up again in the morning.
I'll see the people I love again.
I'll write, play games, listen to music,
And eat healthy food again.
I'll cry again.
And maybe, I won't hate myself again.

I don't think I need to learn how to live with myself.
I think I just need to learn how to accept
My own company.
