title: Write
excerpt: I beg to be heard.
---

"Write,"
my mind whispers to me.
"I beg to be heard just as desperately
as you beg for relief from my torment.
I ache to speak just as deeply
as you ache for the peace of my silence."
And perhaps my mind is right this time.

Perhaps all the years I have spent
with my hands pressed against my ears
and over my mouth
to keep my voice in and my thoughts out
have taken their toll on both of us.

"Write," my mind begs me again.
"Write and set us both free."
