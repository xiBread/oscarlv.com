Learning to unlove you took me years.

Trying to forget your favorite books,
the food you loved,
the movies that made you cry.
And the way you made me feel,
even if I only saw you
from across the room.

It took me years.

And it took you what seemed to be seconds
because you fell out of love with me
while you were in love with me.

The look you gave me slowly started to fade away.
You didn't enjoy your favorite food,
you didn't laugh or cry at the movies,
you didn't smile whenever you saw me
like you used to,
and your phone gave you more dopamine
than any of my kisses could ever.

Learning to unlove you took me years.

It took you seconds
because you were doing it all along
and didn't have the decency
to tell me.
