You said that you needed time,
That you needed space,
That you didn't know what you wanted,
That you couldn't give me an answer,
Not yet.

So I said, then,
That I couldn't promise that I'd wait for you.

And therein lay,
The first time I had ever lied to you.
For that, I am sorry.

But it seems as though,
That lie has *only* ever hurt me.

And so I laugh
For what a fucking fool I am.
