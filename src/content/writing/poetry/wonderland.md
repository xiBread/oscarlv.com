Welcome to Wonderland, we've got it all.
The world isn't safe.
There isn't a place where I can hide
Where sneering faces and harsh words won't reach.
Everything is wide open, and no matter how much I cover myself,
I will be found.
Except here.

Welcome to Wonderland, look where you're at.
Leaves rustle, and birds sing,
Creating the homely atmosphere I've come to love.
None of the prodding fingers and hateful stares
Are welcome here.
Here is safe.
Here is home.

Dancing through a dream underneath the stars.
The sky is a million jewels
Hand-sewn into black velvet.
Each glowing star: a beacon of hope.
Hope.
Something that places a warm feeling in my chest.
Something I only feel here.

Welcome to Wonderland, I'll be your guide.
From all the nights I've spent here,
The countless hours of laughing and smiling.
I know this place like the back of my hand.
I could take yours and guide you
Through the weaving trees and down to the ocean,
Where the sand feels like heaven under your feet.

Nothing around here is quite as it seems.
Tiny fireflies twirl through the leaves,
Casting a dream aura over the land.
A peaceful humming fills the air
As they nestle against my hands.

If this was a dream,
Then at least I've got memories for when morning comes.
A fragile smile climbs onto my face
As the fireflies light up the night with their humble glow.
They were so gentle,
So loving.
I never want to leave this.

Now then, I must leave with a heavy heart.
I can feel myself fading away,
A tingling sensation rising from my feet
To my hands to my chest.
I throw one last look at the beauty surrounding me.
I wish I could stay here
Forever.
Oh, Wonderland, I love.
I wake up.
