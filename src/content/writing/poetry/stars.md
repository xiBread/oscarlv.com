I hate the stars.
I used to stare at them at night,
seeing if I could spot the constellations.
I'd always get them wrong.
Orion's Belt, Big Dipper, Cassiopeia.
They all taunted me.

I've tried talking to the stars, too.
It was a lot of apologizing.
"I'm sorry that I couldn't do more."
"It often feels like my fault."
And the stars would always shine
just a little brighter.
I didn't know what that meant.
I thought it meant that they were also blaming me.
So I'd get angry at the night sky.
The stars saw me in my most vulnerable state.
The stars would make me cry.
And I hated it.

I still talk to the stars.
You'd think I'd be happy
on nights when it's cloudy.
I'm upset.

Please, talk to me.
Make me feel at fault.
Tell me that I was in the wrong.
Tell me that I deserve all of my problems.
I need you to make me cry.
