excerpt: The words she spoke made my soul ache.

"I want to die."

The words she spoke made my soul ache.
I couldn't burn her pain and blow it to the wind,
For the ashes would cover my heart and sting my eyes.
But I could tell her she'd be okay.

Maybe it would be true.
Maybe she would again smile at the sun's orange that leaked through her blinds,
and find the purpose he'd been so desperate to see.
Or maybe misery would rob her eyes,
leaving her blind to sights of rare beauty scattered through places yet discovered.

Her name just another statistic.

So I held her tightly and let her tears stain my shirt.
My great attempt to save her from herself
that almost went unnoticed.
