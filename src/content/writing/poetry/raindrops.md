title: Raindrops
---

I leave my umbrella behind often,
whether the rain is drizzling or pouring.
I feel the droplets on my skin,
tracing the shape of my body,
caressing me,
holding me tightly,
giving me promises of love,
then leaving.
No goodbye,
no farewell,
just a silent departure to mark the end
of our short time together.

More droplets,
more empty promises,
more wasted time,
the more lost I feel
until I'm brought to my knees
in the middle of nowhere.

I'm too stubborn to protect myself.
Why can't I stop chasing this idea of love?
When did I start confusing my tears for raindrops?
