title: Eyes
---

your eyes fell out of love first.

take them off of me,
those ghost-filled eyes.

so cold and cruel,
so wicked and strange.

your empty stare
somehow manages to fill the pit of my stomach
with a weight i am not strong enough to hold.

to think these hollow beams of brown
belonged to the same girl
that i loved so dearly.

keep the daggers
that you're staring into my back.
i have been scarred enough.
