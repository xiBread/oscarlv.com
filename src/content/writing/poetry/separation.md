title: Separation

*Separate the art from the artist.*
*Separate the art from the artist.*
*Separate the art from the artist.*

Why is it so hard?
Why can't I treat you like a normal person anymore?

My vision of you became skewed,
and I wish I could forget
the way you left me
on that Wednesday afternoon.

*Separate the art from the artist.*
