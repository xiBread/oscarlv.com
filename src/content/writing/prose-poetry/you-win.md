"All good things must come to an end," is how it goes, isn't it? I guess I never really understood what it meant until I lost you.

I'm still full of questions, but I'm not sure if I even want answers anymore. Do you ever wonder about me like the way I wonder about you? Do your siblings ever bring me up at dinner? Do you ever wish we could just start over?

Are you okay? The last time we spoke, you didn't seem alright. But that's not my place anymore, so, I can't ask.

Do you even think about what happened and wonder where we would be if it didn't? I do, but that probably makes me sound crazy. Because I should just let you go, right? I should just move on, drop everything I knew about you, and pretend we never even happened. Pretend I didn't approach you and try to build a bond I believed in. But I can't pretend that it didn't happen.

I saw so much going for you, you know? So much positivity, even though you never failed to push me back down. I'm not blaming you, though. But I just want to know, did you actually care about me, or was it really just a game?

You befriended me, and then it became something real. And things both went wrong in our own lives. And then you got stuck with me. And then you just decided you didn't need me anymore, and you needed a reason. You needed a reason to hate me so you could shut me out.

That's what it was, right? Because I meant literally nothing to you. And if that's not true, then show me how it's not true. Because something like what we had doesn't just crash and burn after somebody's mistake. You're supposed to grow, and you never let me grow.

And you're afraid to let that show, aren't you? You're afraid for everyone to know that you were the bad one. It wasn't just me. But it's okay because one day, they'll all know. We'll just have to wait and see, won't we?

And after a month and a half, I found myself calling you a memory, and I never wanted that. Because I wanted us to last, you know? I wanted a future together. But you just didn't want that anymore. I'd be lying if I said it still didn't hurt. But I guess I understand.

You wanted me to give you space? You got it. You wanted me to stop texting you? You got it. You wanted me to leave you alone? You fucking got it.

If you don't need me anymore, you probably never will. But that one day, when you try to reach back out to me, I won't be there. You didn't listen to me when I was there. You didn't hear me when I was there. You didn't answer me when I was there.

I know I'm not perfect, but at least I know I tried. I sacrificed everything just to make you happy. So don't expect me to try when you're ready.

Your love was a losing game, and you won.
