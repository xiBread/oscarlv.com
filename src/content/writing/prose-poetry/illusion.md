excerpt: How am I supposed to see my suffering as a means to an end?
---

"Do you think you'd fix anything if you had the ability to go back in time?"

You want to know what I'm scared of more than anything else? I'm scared that one day, I'll see someone who's hurt me again. I'm scared they'll look at everything that I've done, then stare directly into my eyes and ask, "Wasn't it worth it in the end?"

I fear, more than anything, someone will interpret the suffering they inflicted unto me as a necessary evil that led me to success. The belief that I would never succeed without them hurting me just *cannot* be true. I will *never* accept it as true.

I also hate it when others try to rationalize my suffering for me. They'll tell me that, at the very least, I learned an important lesson. They'll tell me that everything I've been through was all a part of some bigger picture, that it'll all work out.

But how am I supposed to see it that way? How am I supposed to accept that every tear I've shed, every connection I've lost was worth it in the end?

How am I supposed to see my suffering as a means to an end?

I don't think there is a single person in the world that could convince me to not go back and change the past. There is no one that could convince me that it would be a morally correct decision to accept suffering and "become a better person from it."

So when you ask me if I want to go back and fix my mistakes, I do. More than anything, I'd like to know if I would still be the same if I knew I had a choice. Maybe that's just the illusion of choice. No one would consciously choose to suffer, but it happens anyway.

I guess I just never got to choose who I am.
