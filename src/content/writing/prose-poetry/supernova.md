title: Supernova
excerpt: I wonder if the universe will feel lonely before it dies.
---

I remember talking about the universe would end with my science teacher when I was in middle school. He drew on a napkin to explain how, in a billion years, the sun would go supernova and cause the heat death of the universe.

I don't think humans will be alive when that happens. Maybe nothing will be alive at that point. Isn't that a little sad? The end is inevitable, yet no one will be able to witness it.

I wonder if the universe will feel lonely before it dies. Sometimes, when I'm watching the sunset, I like to imagine the heat death of the universe is happening just so someone would be there to accompany it.

When the sun goes supernova, the skies will turn yellow like my favorite sour candy that stings my tongue. Then it'll turn into the orange that my parents peel for me because I bite my nails, followed by the pink cotton candy that I'd take apart with my hands over and over again. Afterward, it would turn into the blue swimming pool that I'd learned to swim in. And finally, right before everything goes dark, the purple skies would show my favorite color as if to thank me for being there in its last moments.

All that's left are the stars and neighboring universes, and if I'm lucky, I'll see a shooting star. I'd use my wish to experience it from the star one more time.

I want to grow up again. I want to see my family again. I want to taste and feel and experience the things I love again. I want to do all of it again. More than anything, I don't want things to end yet. The heat death of the universe shouldn't be a daily occurence, but I'd keep making the same wish every day because I'm selfish.

I don't know when I'll be ready or if I ever will be. Maybe in a billion years. In the meantime, I'd like one more supernova.
