title: Repetition
excerpt: My mother taught me this trick.

My mother taught me this trick where if you repeat something over and over again, it loses its meaning.

For example: homework.

<div class="text-center">
	<p class="opacity-90">Homework,</p>
	<p class="opacity-80">homework,</p>
	<p class="opacity-65">homework,</p>
	<p class="opacity-50">homework,</p>
	<p class="opacity-35">homework,</p>
	<p class="opacity-20">homework.</p>
	<p class="opacity-10">homework.</p>
	<br />
	<p>See? Nothing.</p>
</div>

"Our lives," she said, "are the same way." You watch the sunset too often, it just becomes 6 P.M. You make the same mistake over and over, you'll stop calling it a mistake if you just wake up,

<div class="text-center">
	<p class="opacity-90">wake up,</p>
	<p class="opacity-80">wake up,</p>
	<p class="opacity-65">wake up,</p>
	<p class="opacity-50">wake up,</p>
	<p class="opacity-35">wake up,</p>
	<p class="opacity-20">wake up.</p>
	<p class="opacity-10">wake up.</p>
</div>

One day, you'll forget why. "Nothing is forever," she said. My parents left each other when I was seven years old. Before their last argument, they sent me off to the neighbor's house like some astronaut jettisoned from the shuttle. When I came back, there was no gravity in our home. I imagined it as an accident&mdash;that when I left, they whispered to each other, "I love you," so many times over that they forgot what it meant.

<div class="text-center">
	<p class="opacity-90">Family,</p>
	<p class="opacity-80">family,</p>
	<p class="opacity-65">family,</p>
	<p class="opacity-50">family,</p>
	<p class="opacity-35">family,</p>
	<p class="opacity-20">family.</p>
	<p class="opacity-10">family.</p>
</div>

My mother taught me this trick where if you repeat something over and over again, it loses its meaning. This became my favorite game. It made the sting of words evaporate.

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 text-center">
	<span>Separation.</span>
	<span>Separation.</span>
	<span>Separation.</span>
	<br />
	<p class="mt-1">See? Nothing.</p>
</div>

<div class="mt-6 grid grid-cols-3 text-center">
	<span>Apart.</span>
	<span>Apart.</span>
	<span>Apart.</span>
	<br />
	<p class="mt-1">See? Nothing.</p>
</div>

I'm an injured handyman now. I've worked with words all dayâ€”shut up, I know the irony. When I was young, I was taught that the trick to dominating language was breaking it down, convincing it that it was worthless.

<div class="text-center">
	<p class="opacity-90">I love you.</p>
	<p class="opacity-80">I love you.</p>
	<p class="opacity-65">I love you.</p>
	<p class="opacity-50">I love you.</p>
	<p class="opacity-35">I love you.</p>
	<p class="opacity-20">I love you.</p>
	<p class="opacity-10">I love you.</p>
	<br />
	See? Nothing.
</div>

Soon after my parents' divorce, I developed a stutter. Fate is a cruel and efficient tutor. There is no escape in stutter. You can feel the meaning of every word drag itself up your throat.

S-s-s-s-s-s-s-separation.

Stutter is a cage made of mirrors. Every "What'd you say?" Every "Just take your time." Every "Come on, kid, just spit it out." There's a glaring reflection of an existence you cannot escape. Every awful moment trips over its own announcement again and again and again until it just hangs there in the center of the room, as if what you had to say had no gravity at all.

Mom. Dad. I'm not wasteful with my words anymore. Even now, after hundreds of hours, practicing away my stutter, I still feel the claw of meaning in the bottom of my throat. Listen to me. I've heard that even in space, you can hear the scratch of an

I-I-I-I-I-I-I love you.
