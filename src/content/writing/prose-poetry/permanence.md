excerpt: Who am I but someone who is defined by the people that I've lost?

Emotions come and go. At least, that's what I believed all this time. Feelings of happiness and sadness pass through. They embody the human experience with their impermanence. It should make sense. It makes sense to others. Why doesn't it make sense to me?

Every morning, when I wake up, I feel as if I lost something important. I remember the people that I lost as soon as I open my eyes. They are the first people I think of every day. This sadness does not leave me, and I don't understand how to get rid of it. I've tried, too. I've shared my struggle with other people, I've tried to repair those relationships, and I've written my feelings. Every morning starts the same, no matter how hard I try.

I often wonder if I'm a separate being from my grief. Who am I but someone who is defined by the people that I've lost? But surely, the sadness should've passed, right? When I lose someone, I should grieve, right? Then why? Why? Why can't I forget their faces? Why can't I forget the love that I was never able to reciprocate? I want to be freed of this guilt. But I know that without this guilt, I would lose myself.

So I'll keep writing. I'll feel that guilt a hundred times over in words that I wish were true. I am my guilt. I am my grief. My life experience has been defined by loss, so I will start living with it. I hope these emotions never pass through so I can remember the depth of each loss.
