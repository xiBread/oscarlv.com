excerpt: I let myself be vulnerable too easily.

*Hi, nice to meet you.*

We had only just met, but you know that feeling you get when you meet someone and something just clicks? That's what I felt. I recognized those eyes like I recognized my whole being.

Every night, I go to sleep wondering what you're thinking about right now. It's an unhealthy habit that I picked up a few years ago. The worst part about it is that I never get an answer. And so, I overthink.

<span class="inline-block w-full ml-[16ch]">Are you just being nice?</span>
<span class="inline-block w-full text-center ml-[16ch]">Is this just how extroverts act?</span>
<span class="inline-block w-full text-center mr-[4ch]">Why'd you decide to sit next to me?</span>
<span class="inline-block w-full ml-[18ch]">Did you enjoy the lunch we had?</span>
<span class="inline-block w-full ml-[24ch]">Am I boring to talk to?</span>
<span class="inline-block w-full text-center ml-[7ch]">Am I making you uncomfortable?</span>
<span class="inline-block w-full ml-[11ch]">I hope not.</span>
<span class="inline-block w-full text-center ml-[14ch]">I'm sorry if I am.</span>
<span class="inline-block w-full text-center">What am I to you?</span>

*Oh, you have a boyfriend? That's nice. He's lucky to have you.*

I can't fall for every cute girl I meet who's nice to me and then get upset that nothing came out of it; that's how I end up going insane and paranoid. I don't want to become cynical.

How can I get my heart broken by someone who doesn't even realize the impact they have on me? I guess I only have myself to blame. I did this. I let myself be vulnerable too easily. Learn to guard your heart, idiot.

*You're a really cool person. I'm glad we became friends.*

It hurts thinking of everything we could've been. I wish I could tell you,

<span class="inline-block w-full text-center">how I can't wait to see you in class,</span>
<span class="inline-block w-full ml-[20ch]">how I enjoy your company,</span>
<span class="inline-block w-full text-center ml-[6ch]">how I adore those eyes of yours,</span>
<span class="inline-block w-full ml-[15ch]">how I think you're beautiful.</span>
<span class="inline-block w-full text-center ml-[14ch]">how I think we would be cute together</span>
<span class="inline-block w-full text-center mr-[12ch]">how I feel comfortable to be around you.</span>

But you're happy with him, and that's not who I am. You were good to me. We just were not meant to be. You were not made for me.

All I can be is someone you don't want.

*I'll see you around.*
