Let's fall in love starting from now.

What?

I know you don't want anything serious, but I just want something more. Something more tangible.

So your solution to that is having us fall for each other?

Yes. I'll become obsessed with you, and you'll become obsessed with me. Deal?

That sounds an awful lot like you want us to be in an official relationship.

Well, do you not want to be in a relationship?

I don't think I'm ready for one yet.

Right, so then, let's just fall in love.

How is that any different?

Falling in love is in the small details. Noticing the way that they can't make eye contact for longer than a second or that they love everything peanut butter related. A relationship is acting on those small details so they feel loved.

Oh, so noticing when they bonk their head when they can't figure something out? Or that they really love sour candy?

So you caught on that I was describing you.

I can't believe you just openly admitted that you were falling in love with me already. You just wanted me to fall in love with you too.

Well, since you noticed the small things that I do, doesn't that mean you're falling in love with me too?

No, I was just mocking you.

Yeah. Sure. How funny.

So we only act on those small things we notice when we're in a relationship?

You're spot on. Noticing those small things just means you're falling in love with them. Doing something about those small things is what a relationship is for.

Alright, whatever you say. You want the rest of my Sour Patch Kids?

Are you asking me to be in a relationship with you?

Well, I was already falling in love with you, according to you. And I think I already know all the small details about you, so I can't fall in love with you any more than I already have.

I thought you didn't want anything serious.

Giving you candy isn't that serious, is it? I just have one condition.

What's the condition?

Don't love me too seriously. You like sour candy because it's sweet after, but I can't promise sweetness even after all this sour waiting.

I'm okay with that. I'm so happy we're finally doing this.

I've never seen you smile like that.

Well, I guess there's more to fall in love with than you expected.
