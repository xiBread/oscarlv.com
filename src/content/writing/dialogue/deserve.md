Do you think people are deserving of love?

No.

Really? You think people should just be lonely?

I didn't say that.

Then what?

It's simple, really. I just don't think people deserve love.

Then why do you smile, laugh, and hug? Do you not deserve to feel happy?

I smile, laugh, and hug when I receive love I don't deserve.

But you do deserve love! Everyone deserves to be loved!

Were you an only child growing up?

No, I had two younger siblings. How is this relevant?

Were you loved as much as your siblings?

Well, my parents loved my younger siblings more because they could rely on me being responsible.

So because your siblings were more irresponsible, they deserved more love?

I guess so? That doesn't mean that I wasn't loved and that I wasn't deserving of love.

Your siblings grew up irresponsible because they knew that no matter what they did, they'd still be loved.

Isn't that a good thing?

They always expected to be loved. That they always deserved love.

What's wrong with believing you deserve love?

What happens when they leave home? When they aren't always loved?

Well, they'd make friends that love them too.

They'd make friends only if they were willing to give love too. The difference between giving love and receiving love is enough to tear people apart.

So, what? Should we give more love than we receive?

You and I: we shouldn't expect to receive love at all. We don't deserve love. But others deserve our love. Only when we can give love will we receive love.

What if the person who gives out all their love never receives anything in return?

I've always bought flowers for others. I've always given people a Valentine. I've always complimented others. I've always confessed my feelings for others. I've never received one of these things.

Do you get tired of it?

Yes. Absolutely. But I don't deserve love. Others do. How will people know that they're loved if I'm not the one to show them how much I love them?

I love you.

That's the first time someone's said that to me.

Did you deserve it?

No.
