I'm sorry.

I still don't understand why you want to break up.

You love the *idea* of me. Not the actual me.

What?

Why are you always the priority in this relationship? Why are we both putting you first? It's reached the point where I'm self-conscious whenever I talk to you. I shouldn't constantly be questioning whether I'm a needy person.

Why didn't I know about this sooner? You're always the one saying that communication is key.

It is. But communication isn't shit without comprehension. *Your* comprehension.

You're starting to make me feel stupid. Whenever you bring us up, I never know what to say or do. Don't I tell you I love you all the time? Don't I show you off to all my loved ones? I don't understand why I'm not good enough. Why are you trying to fix something that wasn't broken in the first place? Isn't what we have enough?

It obviously isn't if we're having this conversation.

But isn't love enough to–

No. Don't pull that bullshit excuse again. Love is not enough to make a relationship work. I can barely squeeze a word in whenever I'm with you and other people. You always do all the talking, even when telling a story involving me. I can't interject either because it always ends in a fight about how I was being "rude."

But–

I'm going to ask you a question. I don't even care if you're honest with me; just be honest with yourself.

Ok&hellip;

Are you actually in love with me, or do you just love the idea of a trophy partner?

"Trophy partner" is a pretty cynical way to put it, don't you think? &hellip;I don't know what you're expecting me to say.

Sounds like an answer to me.

I just don't understand why you're so hung up on whether I love you. Am I not doing enough to prove that? Or do I need to get on top of a roof and profess it like I'm in a Shakespeare play?

Just–

God, I am *so* in LOVE with you! I can barely feel my face from the butterflies I'm getting from talking to you right now!

Shut up.

The sight of your glorious face makes me physically melt. A night full of stars could *never* compare to–

Can you shut the fuck up?! &hellip;I'm sorry.

I just hate fighting with you.

I hate fighting with you too&hellip; It's the pressure of having to say it back.

Huh?

That's my answer to your question. You're just always so&hellip; comfortable when you say it. You look like you feel safe whenever you say, "I love you." It makes me feel guilty if I don't say it because I'll hurt you. So I say it.

Oh&hellip; Then I think I understand what you meant by the "idea of you."

You think so?

I'm not saying "I love you" to you who says it in return. I'm saying "I love you" to some echo chamber of myself.

Huh. You actually got it.
