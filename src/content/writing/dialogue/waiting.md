title: Waiting
---

Do you ever just feel like you're always waiting?

Yeah, I had to wait 10 minutes for my food today.

That's tragic. My sincerest apologies.

We really live in a waitocracy. The more power you have, the less you have to wait.

That has really concerning implications.

Right? I mean, I'd have to wait an infinite amount of time to obtain nuclear launch codes. How messed up is that?

I think you're missing my point by just a little bit.

Oh, I didn't hit the mark? I thought I was spot on.

I mean, it feels like I'm just waiting for something to happen to me. My transformation. My glow up.

Like a butterfly?

Yeah. I'm so jealous of butterflies. One day, they just know that they're ready to become something beautiful.

You want to just change your entire life in one day?

Wouldn't that be so much fun? It's as if I decided to just move to a new country and completely reinvent myself.

Why would you want to do that?

I just feel so stuck. It feels like I'm waiting for life to happen to me. Like a really long dream that I need to wake up from.

So you want to be someone new?

I mean, what other choice do I have? Nothing I do feels right, and I just don't feel attractive or wanted. If I was someone different, I could have everything.

I don't think that's true.

That's because you're smart and handsome! You live in a completely different world than the rest of us, whereas I'm stuck all alone because no one wants to stay with me.

I do. I want to stay with you.

But how much longer until you leave too? It feels like everyone's on a timer before our relationship expires. If only I were more attractive, more wanted, and less like myself, then they'd stay.

Why do you think I'll leave?

Because you have stuff figured out! I feel like a bumbling mess trying to figure out life as I go, but you know what you're doing. You're so much better than me.

I'm really not. I have no idea what I'm doing in life. I hold onto what I'm good at, but I feel so lost when it comes to anything else. I know what it's like to feel trapped.

Oh. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have assumed anything.

No, it's fine. Please, don't change yourself completely. You *are* attractive. You *are* smart. You're the only one I can go to for so many things. You listen so well and tell me what I need to hear.

But there are so many things I don't like about myself.

But there are so many things I like about you. I know that there are people that aren't in your life anymore, but it wasn't your fault. There's nothing about you that needs to be completely changed.

I'm the common factor each time someone leaves.

You'll never have perfect judgment in every scenario. You're putting too much pressure on only yourself to maintain every relationship because it's their fault too. Relationships are always two-sided.

None of it would've happened if I was just someone different.

We wouldn't be close if you were someone different. You put so much emphasis on a transformation, but what about the rest of us that loves you as you are?

I can still be better. I can grow.

And you don't need to sacrifice a part of yourself to do that! You can grow as yourself, not as someone completely different.

So you want me to just be myself? This feels like a High School Musical message.

This is actually the plot of the new High School Musical. Troy turns into a butterfly.

I'd pay to see that movie.

Then let's direct it together.

Seriously though, thank you. I feel like you're the only one I could talk about this with.

Of course. I love you as you are. I won't leave you. I promise.

I guess you're the one I've been waiting for.

Hope it didn't take too long.
