I think we need to talk.

Again? You always want to talk about us.

No, I'm done this time.

What do you mean you're done?

I'm done trying. Done putting in all the love of this relationship. Done with dealing with all of your bullshit.

You think I haven't been trying? You know how much I love you, and I'm putting in as much as I can.

Do you know how many times I've heard "I love you" from you? They all felt so artificial like you're just repeating what you practiced in the mirror.

You never felt like I actually loved you?

No. It always felt like I was taking care of you and your problems like I was your therapist or caregiver. You don't love me. You love what I can do for you.

You never came to me with your problems, and I never knew what to talk about. I wanted to spend meaningful time with you, and I only knew how to talk about myself.

Then what's the point of this relationship?

I love being with you and spending time with you. I love going on car rides and listening to you sing. There's so much I love about you.

You're just listing the stuff you love about me. What part of that justifies us being in a relationship?

What do you mean? I love you. Is that not enough?

If you asked me what I loved about you, I wouldn't be able to come up with anything. It just feels like every time we meet, I have to love you back to life. What happens when I can't love you anymore?

You mean there's nothing you love about me? What kind of love were you putting into the relationship?

I loved what we used to be. I loved how I was around you; how, whenever we spent time together, it felt like time was warping around us. I loved the things we did together.

Isn't that the same kind of love I was putting in?

No. You loved me. I loved *us*. I loved the relationship and what it meant to be in a relationship.

So you were just using me? You never liked me? You just wanted to be in a relationship to see what it was like?

I liked you at some point. You know, I cried myself to sleep the day I told you I loved you for the first time. I tried so hard to love you, trying to lose myself in your eyes and fall for your smile.

Then what could I have done differently? Loved you more? Told you that you were beautiful more often?

I was so caught up in this idea that I'll fall in love with you once we're in a relationship. I guess it was just never meant to work.

No, you know what? You didn't have to get into a relationship with me. You had no reason to entertain me just because you felt like it. You just wanted to toy with my emotions.

It's not my fault that you can't be emotionally vulnerable with the others around you. I can't be that outlet for you.

I never asked you to. You could've said something, *anything*. But you stayed quiet because you were willing to do anything for a relationship.

So now this is my fault? It's not your fault for springing your emotions on me when you knew I wouldn't be able to reject you?

I didn't say it was your fault. I never meant to put you in an uncomfortable position. Look, can we just talk about this tomorrow?

Let's just say our goodbyes now. I don't know how I'm supposed to face you again after this.

Ok. I'm sorry. I love you.

Don't say that to me ever again.

Ok. I'm sorry. Bye.
