What's this? A bouquet?

Yeah, you mentioned that no one's ever bought you flowers.

You didn't even take the price tag off.

I wanted you to see the massive amount of money I invested. Also, you didn't even thank me.

It says it's $5.

Yeah, I know. That's a lot. I spent a lot of time choosing the best bouquet.

Did you just ask for the cheapest one?

Maybe.

Well&hellip; thank you.

Oh? Is that a genuine thanks?

Yes.

I have something to confess then.

What?

I ate one of the leaves.

Umm&hellip;?

I'm serious.

Why?

I couldn't tell if it was fake or not.

So you just&hellip; ate it.

Well, it was more like I chewed it for a couple of seconds and then spit it out.

You didn't think to ask if it was real?

&hellip;No. Look, it's fine, you can't even tell there's a leaf missing.

What did it taste like?

A leaf. A real one.

How do you know the difference?

&hellip;I plead the fifth.

You're so&hellip; interesting.

Yeah? I can tell you're already falling in love with me.

And what if I am?

I'll get you a $10 bouquet.

Are you sure you can afford that?

Very funny.

Does it come with a missing chewed-up leaf?

Sure does! Multiple even, if you'd like.
