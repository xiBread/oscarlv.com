excerpt: Why do I keep losing the people in my life that matter?

Hello?

I miss you.

Is this seriously what you woke me up for? It's 3:30 in the morning.

Sorry. I just wanted to talk to you again.

Aren't you seeing someone?

Not anymore. I just called things off.

And your first thought was to call me?

Yeah.

I'm going back to sleep.

Wait, please. I know we haven't talked in a while, but&mdash;

You never reached out to me after we broke up, and now you want to talk? Why should I listen?

What did you mean when you said that thing when we broke up?

What thing?

"You only love when it's convenient for you. I always feel like an inconvenience to you."

It meant that you never loved me. You didn't want to try either.

That's not true.

I know what you sound like when you're drunk. Go to bed, I'm leaving.

I left them because I kept seeing you in them.

Jesus Christ&hellip; You used them to relive our relationship?

I&hellip; wanted another chance.

You can't treat other people as chances for redemption.

Am I just unlovable? You never loved me, and they didn't either.

That's not true.

Then why? Why do I keep losing the people in my life that matter?

Stuff doesn't work out all the time, and that's okay. You have to learn to live with that fact.

No, you don't understand. Nothing ever works out for me. I don't know what to do anymore.

Take a deep breath. Relax.

I didn't even cry during our breakup&hellip; Why am I crying now?

Do you actually miss me?

Yes.

You know that I moved cities, right? And I'm not interested in a long-distance relationship. There's no chance for us.

&hellip;Yeah.

Then I'll say this to you as a person who once cared deeply for you: I know how scared you are about everything. I could tell you were scared to love me, but that's not a bad thing. You're just figuring stuff out, and you'll get there someday.

&hellip;

Are you still there?

&hellip;

Well, I assume you passed out. I'm gonna go back to sleep. Goodnight.

I&hellip; I love you&hellip; still.
