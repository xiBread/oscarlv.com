Why do you still think about her?

Because I haven't figured it out yet.

What is there to figure out? She's gone.

There's this idea about how science works by a guy named Thomas Kuhn. And he said that most of the time, science operates under a "paradigm," which is a sort of overarching worldview or theory for how the universe fits together. And that might be the idea that the Earth is at the center of the universe or that gravity is Newtonian or that human nature is inherently good. Or "My partner loves me."

[It turns out that most of the day-to-day of being a scientist is working with this paradigm. You apply its principles, you solve problems, and you see everything through that lens. But what inevitably happens is that anomalies start to pop up. You can't explain the motion of a star or planet in the sky, or she starts coming back later and later after work.]{continue}

[And at first, you dismiss these observations entirely. You think, "Well, I'm just imagining things. That can't have happened." But then you see it again and again, and you move on to ad-hoc hypotheses. You think, "Well, she's having a rough time," or maybe that planet's special in a way we don't understand. But then they just keep on coming, and you find you have to bend further and further to make the data fit in your worldview until you eventually hit a crisis. The paradigm breaks. You don't understand how the world works.]{continue}

And then what happens?

Hopefully, eventually, someone comes up with a new paradigm. It solves most of the old problems, it explains the anomalies, and you get a new truth to see the world with. You have a scientific revolution. Turns out we orbit the sun, gravity is the curvature of spacetime, human nature isn't all that great, and your partner doesn't love you.

But isn't that at least an answer? Why don't you have closure from that?

Because I'm not there yet. I can't get there. She just disappeared. So now I'm just left with a bunch of data that makes no sense, and I can't get anymore. So there is a corner of my mind forever in the crisis stage, which is just feverishly trying to draw new lines of best fit through moments and memories that are only getting further away, just trying to understand what happened and why.

[Why, why?]{continue}
