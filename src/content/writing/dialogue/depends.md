title: Depends
---

I feel like I'm not doing anything right.

Maybe that's because you're trying to measure yourself against something that doesn't really exist.

Like what?

Right and wrong.

What do you mean?

They're just concepts, like everything else. Right and wrong only exist in the perspective of the people judging the actions.

I disagree.

Why?

Well, what if I were to murder someone? Like I just randomly decided to stab someone in the street.

I mean, you probably *shouldn't*, and most people would condemn you for that, but what if that person was actually bad?

Okay, but we're speaking hypothetically. What if they weren't?

You know how people say that if they could time travel, they would go back and kill Hitler as a baby?

Yeah.

Would that make them a bad or good person?

I guess it depends. Most people today would say good because of everything that he did but back then, you'd just be seen as a cold-blooded baby killer.

Exactly. It depends.

Okay, but cherry picking one example that everyone agrees on doesn't prove your point.

Doesn't it? You said it yourself: it depends.

Fine, you got me there. But what about things that are universally wrong? Maybe not murdering random people since, according to you, they *could* be bad, but something like hurting innocent children.

It sounds bad, sure. What about war? People hurt and kill others all the time in war, but depending on which side you're on, it's either justified or not. Soldiers are praised for their bravery, even if their actions involve killing. Those children could grow up into radical leaders and seek vengeance and, I don't know, cause another genocide.

Do you always assume the worst about people? Do you just see babies and think, "Oh, yep, that's the next Hitler?"

Obviously not, but these are the type of questions to ask when deciding what's real and what isn't. What makes war any different than deciding to lie to your mom about smoking weed that one time?

Those are two completely different situations. War is complicated—there's context in defense, survival, politics, freedom. You can't compare that to something as minute as getting high.

Why not? What's the one thing they have in common? Context. Perspective. It's never black and white, nothing is.

So you're saying morals are relative? That nothing is ever objectively wrong? What's stopping me from robbing a bank then?

I'm saying that what we call "morals" are nothing more than just a set of rules that society has happened to adapt to in order to function. But societies change, rules change. What's moral today could be immoral tomorrow.

That just sounds so… nihilistic. Like nothing matters.

I wouldn't say nothing matters. It just means we create the meaning. We're the rule makers, and because of that, they're flexible.

That's a terrifying thought.

Or freeing, depending on how you look at it.

There it is, that word again. "Depends." Everything just *depends*.

Am I wrong, though?

No, I guess not… Are you a good or bad person for telling me this?

I don't know, that's for you to decide.

So you're leaving it to my perspective?

Precisely.

But what if my perspective says this whole conversation was pointless?

Then it is. Or maybe it's not. I can't change what you think.

So… if right and wrong are just "things," then what am I doing or not doing?

Living. Navigating through the unknowns just like anyone else.

But what if I want more than that? What if I want certainty, a path, something to guide me?

Then you make one. You decide what you want. Borrow from what you've learned, what you believe in, and what feels true.

And if I get it wro—er, I mean, what if it doesn't work out?

Then you learn and try again.

So, trial and error? That's your big philosophy?

Pretty much. Life's messy, and people make it messier by trying to pin everything down.

I don't know if that's comforting or depressing.

Maybe it's both. Depends.

Of course it does.

Hey, if nothing else, the fact that you care enough to question this stuff means you care about yourself.

You're a lot more optimistic than I expected for someone who doesn't believe in right and wrong.

Maybe. Or maybe I'm just faking it.

Depends, huh?

Now you're getting it.
