I'm not everything I want to be.

Show me an ambitious person who is.

I feel stuck. Every day, I watch myself fail to do the things I feel I ought to. And I hate it.

Because, of course, your entire self-worth is entirely dictated by your productivity.

It's not so much productivity as it is a sense of agency and control.

You can't make yourself do things.

Yeah, I feel paralyzed at times. It's like I'm trapped in a glass box, watching my own inaction. I kick the walls, but nothing happens.

So why do you keep kicking the walls?

Because it's worked before. Once or twice.

So you think you can, at least in principle, do all these things?

Yes, which is why it's all the more despairing.

When every day you fall short of your expectations.

Exactly, I just feel that I can't even get the basics right. I can't even do the bare minimum.

Have you ever considered that your bare minimum is likely rather high?

I don't think it is. I think it's reasonable to have those expectations of myself.

And yet, you consistently fail. So let's be honest here, they're not reasonable.

It should be.

But again, it isn't. Tell me this, would you expect others to meet these standards?

No.

There it is. Your notion of "should" comes from your ego.

How can I have ego? I don't even like myself half of the time.

Ego isn't liking yourself. It's thinking you're better than you are. It's a misalignment between reality and your expectations. What you've fallen into is a viscious cycle. It offers you the promise that you really are better, special, and destined for great things. But you pay for it every day. The misery, the poison. It drips into you. Day by day, you fail to meet your expectations. Reality always hits.

What's wrong with trying to be better?

Nothing inherently, but why do you *want* to be better?

What else is there to do?

You're not serious, are you?

I mean, yeah, I'm kinda serious.

Well, I could think of quite a few things you could do instead, but they all involve actually living.

I'm trying to, but I'm flawed.

And?

Should we not try to fix our flaws?

In my mind, they give a person character.

Charming for some, but I feel like I'm more fundamentally defective.

So you're fundamentally flawed, and you're destined for greatness. You truly are just *so* special.

I know it sounds stupid, but I feel as though I have the ingredients to be great, but I'm missing a key piece. Which means that I'm worse than if I didn't have those ingredients at all.

Tell me, if you met someone like you, someone with grand ambitions who couldn't realise them, someone who was stuck in the inaction of every day, would you have empathy for them?

Honestly? Of course I'd be nice and kind and polite and say all the right things, but no.

Because you'd see yourself in them.

Yeah. My worst fear.

No wonder you mistreat yourself. If looking in the mirror is *that* bad, then of course you'd cling to delusion.

So what do you suggest I do?

Get over yourself. I mean that lovingly.

Gee, thanks, I wish I'd thought of that before.

A bit of self-compassion and empathy wouldn't go astray either.

Oh, come on.

Not for any moral reason, mind you. No, I know you don't want any pity. I'm just a practical person. Consider this. You have tried the same tactic for years, and it has gotten you nowhere. Maybe it worked once or twice, maybe even worked for a time, but it doesn't work anymore. So why not try a different approach? Besides, what have you got to lose? It's not like you're doing anything anyway.

But maybe if I just tried harder, I&mdash;

Oh sure, try that for another year, see where it gets you. We can resume our conversation when you eventually come to conclusion that you can't brute force everything.

Fine. It doesn't work. At least for me.

Okay, genius, then try a different way. Try humility, try lowering your standards, try observing yourself. Observing your patterns of behavior and lowering your standards even beneath that. Make it such that you can experience at least a modicum of pleasure. Because right now, even if you achieve perfection, the only thing you'll experience is not pleasure, but relief.

It's not a fun game to play.

So it's little wonder you sit on the bench.

So I have to "accept myself."

Yes, you must learn to look at that reflection with full acceptance, no flinching. This is who you currently are, and that's fine.

It's "fine?"

Yes, "fine." Not fine as in done, not fine as in resigned to it. Fine as in fine. Fine as in having no negative emotion. Fine as in being able to experience excitement for the possibilities of the future. Fine in the same way that a blank canvas is fine. Fine the same way that a bud of a flower is fine before it blooms. It's fine.

I'm not sure.

What would you be willing to do in order to fix yourself?

Anything.

Really?

I think so.

Then do the hardest thing: look at yourself fully. Accept it. Embrace it. Love it. Swallow your pride. Realise that every day, you are trying to run a marathon with a broken leg, and you are only making it worse. Have the humility to do the small things, take the small steps, and build from there.

And what then?

We'll have much more to talk about.
