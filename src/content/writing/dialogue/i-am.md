Do you understand yourself?

I try to.

What's that like? How do you try?

What do you mean?

What do you think of yourself?

Well, I started piano because my mom played piano for me when I was young. I can't fall asleep without saying goodnight to each one of my stuffed animals because my sister did that.

You're just describing the stuff you picked up from others.

I still look at old birthday cards that my ex-friend gave me. I still read the Webtoon that an old crush recommended to me. I can't speak the language my parents speak, but I can understand it.

Where are you going with this?

You're trying to understand yourself. There won't be a day when you become enlightened and you know everything about yourself.

Then why'd you say that you're trying to understand yourself?

Who are we but an amalgamation of the fragments of life that others give to us? These memories, experiences, and keepsakes are what make us.

So this conversation we're having, this memory we have together, is a part of me?

Yes. Don't spend all of your energy on "discovering yourself." See what you hold close to your heart, and hold it closer. Just be.

That sounds pretty hippie. Are you high?

I'm being serious. You know, every day, I regret quitting piano and not learning my parent's language. But I hold these regrets close because they're a part of me.

It just sounds like you really don't want to learn Chinese.

It's not my fault that it's an impossible language.

So you don't just accept failure, you accept failure as a part of yourself?

I got ghosted by a Tinder match after sharing a conversation about falling in love. I learned from it. Now it's a part of me.

I forgot you're a hopeless romantic.

That's a key part of my identity.

Not a good thing.

Probably not.

Do you have any other regrets?

Plenty. I've lost many people in my life because I didn't learn something important. But I learned after.

I'm sorry that all happened.

It's okay. I remember my lowest points fondly.

Why?

I am my lowest points, my worst experiences. I am how I react to my world crumbling. If I don't remember them fondly, then who am I?

You're strong. You're loved. You're a universe, worlds, put into a body.

I am?

You are.

I am.
