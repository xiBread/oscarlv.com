# Stranger

"You are not the person I want anymore."
At that exact moment, I don't even recognize you anymore,
You felt like a stranger to me.

The person I fell for would always tell me,
"I love you, I will never hurt you."

"You deserve someone better."
Maybe I do, but why can't it be you?
Was I not worth it for you to become better?
