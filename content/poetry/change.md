# Change

You don't know my favorite color anymore.
I changed it.
It was the same as yours,
So now it's blue.
I got a new perfume too.
It smells like vanilla.
Not like the rose one you used to love.
My bedsheets are different too.
They aren't the white ones with sunflowers on them.
The ones we used to get tangled in.
They're gray now and softer.
I changed my number too.
My old one is out of service now.
I cut my hair too.
It's not grown out the way you liked it anymore.

I changed a lot of things
Since you left.
I find comfort in knowing that
You don't know me anymore,
Just like I no longer know you.
The only difference is that
I changed because I had to.
You changed because you wanted to.
At least I have softer sheets now.
