> I swear I'm not an art person

At a glance, programming and art seem like polar opposites, but the two have more in common than it may seem. I'm a logical and meticulous person, fascinated by what makes things work, paying attention to the finest of details.

[**Programming**]{.text-sm .leading-10}\
I taught myself how to program during the COVID-19 pandemic and have been learning ever since. I spent the summer of 2019 learning JavaScript in the context of [Node.js][Node], later switching to [TypeScript][TS], which is what I primarily use today.

After becoming comfortable with the back end layer, I started exploring the front end. I was eager to experiment with a web framework, and [Vue][Vue] immediately attracted me, along with its meta framework, [Nuxt][NX].

Throughout my learning, I've picked up basic knowledge of various other languages and full stack technologies, such as [C#][C#], [Ruby][RB], [Tailwind][TW], and [PostgreSQL][PG].

[**Art**]{.text-sm .leading-10}\
I express my creative side through photography and writing (mainly poetry). For the longest time, I hated visual art because of how subjective it was, and in all fairness, I still think that. But I found that with photography, it's easier to portray a message.

I started taking pictures of nature with my phone in middle school. I got hands-on experience with a professional camera when I joined my middle school yearbook team. Now I use a [Nikon DX D5600][Nikon] and do any editing in Lightroom and Photoshop.
