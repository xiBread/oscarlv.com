> I swear I'm not an art person

Programming, a logical and analytical subject, and art, an imaginative and dynamic activity. Two
very different fields, yet I've somehow found a balance. But why, and how did I get here?

I taught myself how to program during the COVID-19 pandemic and have been learning ever since. My
tech stack consists of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org),
[Vue](https://vuejs.org), [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), and
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org). I also have experience with [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp)
and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en), and I am currently learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

My interest in photography stems from being a very precise and meticulous person. I started with
just my phone, then became a photography for my 8th grade yearbook, and finally explored my full
potential in high school. I use a [Nikon DX D5600][Nikon] and do any editing in Adobe Lightroom
and/or Adobe Photoshop. In 2022, I won two national silver medals in the [Scholastic Art & Writing Awards](https://www.artandwriting.org)
for [digital art][P1] and [photography][P2].
