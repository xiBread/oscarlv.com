# Addicted

I always wondered,
And still to this day wonder,
*Why you?*

What made you so damn special?
What made my heart skip a beat each time I saw you?
What made my eyes glue to you in a room full of people?
What drew my heart closer to yours than to anyone else's?
Why did everyone else become
"Everyone else"
The second I met you?

I don't know what it was about you,
But that one thing about you
Is somewhere lost in the stars,
And it won't exist within anyone else.
I became addicted to you,
And you became my drug.

I miss that drug.
