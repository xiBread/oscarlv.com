# Eternity

The thought that there is someone out there
who is meant for you
has never quite sat well with me.
What's the point in loving anyone else?
You may argue
"experience"
but if it's all supposed to work out,
then is it necessary?
I don't believe so.

Yet here I am,
finding myself following an unknown path
with you at the end of it.
I envy you.
Your soul moves so fluidly.
Every word spoken, every gesture made,
done with such grace,
as if you don't care.

Every night,
I lay awake,
wondering about you.
Wondering if you're the one they talk about.
Wondering what your life is like
behind the scenes.
Do you obsess over the parts of yourself
that make you
proud?
Self-conscious?
Ashamed?

You pollute my mind,
filling my thoughts with futures
I would've never imagined.
But I see you not as a distraction,
but as motivation
to be better.

I question if I'm right for you;
if I'm good enough;
if I deserve you.
Would you love me
with all of my scars?
My trauma?
My flaws?
Would you love me if I hid them away?
I hope you can see
I'm only trying to be me
for you.

I often find myself in reverie,
picturing what it would be like
to be beside you.
We'd go to the movies,
shop for dresses,
paint our nails.
We'd return to my apartment
and you'd lay next to me
while I gently brush your hair
as we fall asleep
watching Gilmore Girls.
I'd give you everything.

But at the end of the day,
I wake in the presence of your absence,
alone,
without you in my arms.

If only you knew what I wouldn't give
to spend eternity with you.
