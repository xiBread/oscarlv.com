# Snowstorm

Have you been in a snowstorm before?

I can't say I have. It doesn't snow where I'm from.

Did you know when snow falls, it muffles all noise? When you're in a blizzard, it's just deafening silence.

That sounds scary. I can't imagine being stranded like that.

I like it though. When it snows, I run outside into the middle of the storm. Into the silence.

Why? Don't you get cold?

Do you ever feel like there's too much noise? That you can't hear your own thoughts because of how much is happening?

Isn't that the plot of Everything Everywhere All At Once?

Yeah. Life is just so absurd that it feels wrong to want to feel human. Everyone thinks running into a storm is absurd, but waking up for a 9 to 5 is absurd.

I don't think the average person actively throws themself into a blizzard.

Storms aren't complicated like humans. They can't make promises that they'll eventually break. That's their appeal to me, at least.

Appeal? Storms have an appeal? Am I missing something?

They make me feel alive. The cold biting my skin. The snowflakes piling on my hair. The deafening silence. Nothing comes close.

I wish I could run into storms like you.

It's really not that hard. Just chase whatever makes you feel alive. and get rid of all the things holding you back.

Okay. I have feelings for you.

What?

You said chase what makes me feel alive, and I've been chasing you this whole time. I've been too scared to say anything, but you told me to run into a storm.

I'm sorry&hellip; I don't really know what to say.

That's okay. I didn't expect you to respond. I know I just sprang this on you.

What about me makes you feel alive?

The way you talk about everything and see the world in such a beautiful life. You make me feel like I'm seeing the world through your eyes.

I'm sorry, I never meant to lead you on.

You shouldn't feel bad about leading me on by just being yourself. I like you for who you are. You weren't trying to make me feel attraction toward you intentionally.

Why did you tell me? You put our friendship on the line. How am I supposed to act the same? Isn't this selfish?

Yeah, I'm being selfish. I'm basically saying my feelings matter more than the relationship we've established now.

Then why'd you risk it?

I'd rather run into a storm than stay inside, like you. I'd understand if you don't want to talk to me anymore.

No, it's not that I don't want to talk to you anymore. I just don't think I see you in that way. I'm sorry. We won't stop talking, though. I promise.

Storms can make promises too, I guess.
