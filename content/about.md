# Oscar Lee-Vermeren

I'm a self-taught full-stack developer focused on reliability. Many of my projects are built using modern tools such as Nuxt, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and PostgreSQL.

I write in my free time and do fine art photography as a hobby. I love learning and innovation, so I'm always open to trying and experimenting with new technologies and art forms.
