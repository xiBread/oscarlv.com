# Reflection

*Why do you do so much?*

Because it's my only option.

*But what's your goal? You're majoring in something obscure and have a job, you're trying to write, learn photography and filmography, and work out consistently. Isn't that too much?*

I don't really see your point.

*Do you ever even have free time? Aren't you giving yourself too much work? How do you find time to live?*

I don't think you understand, this is living.

*You're always doing something, though. Studying at the library, playing an instrument in the practice room, or writing downstairs. It's like I never see you relaxing.*

What do you mean? They're my hobbies, they are relaxing.

*Why are you trying to take up so much time? Why do you always occupy yourself?*
You want the truth?

*Please. I feel like you're working toward something, but I just can't understand you at all.*

I'm scared to be alone by myself, alone with my thoughts. If I'm always doing something, I won't have time to think about where everything in my life went wrong.

*Isn't it normal to process your mistakes? To accept them and move on?*

Isn't it easier if I just write about them? If I just play a song that reminds me of them?

*No. You can't just keep delaying confronting your own problems. You're acknowledging they exist, but you just let them sit there.*

What's wrong with that?

*You need to move on! They're not in your life anymore! Don't you understand that at all?*

What if I don't want to move on? Wouldn't that mean getting rid of all the happy memories I had with them?

*You're not erasing them from your memory. You're accepting that they don't play an important role in your life anymore.*

You're wrong. Just because they're not here anymore doesn't mean they didn't play an important role in my life.

*They don't care about you anymore.*

I still care about them.

*Why?*

You asked me what my goal is, right?

*What* is *your goal? What do you want to be when you grow up?*

I want to be kind. I want to love the people in my life as much as I can, even if I struggle to show them how I feel.

*Then why do you hold these memories of others so close to your heart?*

Each person showed me kindness and warmth at some point. I can be upset at how they treated me, but a lesson comes alongside each heartbreak and betrayal. I don't want to let go of those lessons I've learned.

*Of all the things you could be, why do you want to be kind?*

Eventually, when I'm kind enough to others, they'll teach me how to be kind to myself. One day, after all this pain and suffering, someone will teach me. So I'll keep being kind.

*You're not kind to yourself already?*

It's always the kindest people who look to others to teach them how to be kind to themselves. I hold onto the memories and lessons because I always could've been kinder in those situations. My goal is to be my kindest self.

*Isn't weird to be talking to yourself like this? In a mirror? I'm just you, and you're just me.*

Yeah, I guess it is. But I'm glad we're having this conversation.

*You should be kinder to yourself.*

I know.
