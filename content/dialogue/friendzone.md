# Friendzone

How do you know when you like someone?

It's really not that hard.

So when you like someone, you just know? A lightbulb just goes off in your head and your dopamine receptors are connected to them?

Yeah, except it's not really a lightbulb. It's more like a gun is pointed toward my brain, so my brain only thinks of them.

Ok, but seriously. How do actually know?

Who is this about?

There's a girl in my chemistry class.

There's always a girl in a chemistry class.

We started talking, and now we're texting. We're gonna study together tomorrow.

Sounds like things are going pretty well. Like there's a lot of chemistry.

You're the main reason why I want to drop out.

I'm honored.

Why do I feel nervous? Does that mean I like her?

How much do you know about her?

I know she's my age and that she's in my chemistry class. And she's pretty attractive.

But?

But?

There's always a but.

&hellip;But I think she's already in a relationship.

You really dug yourself into a hole this time. Why do you think that?

I mean, she acts way too comfortable around me. It's like she's not even worried I'll make a move.

Dude, you don't know her at all. You have this idea of her in your head, but you don't know anything about her as a person.

Right, but I don't want to mess it up.

Mess what up? Let's go through the possible scenarios. Number one: she's in a relationship and all of your worst fears come true. Why do you care so much?

She's just acting too flirty if she *is* in a relationship. It's like she's intentionally leading me on.

No, you're leading yourself on. She isn't trying to act any certain way, you're just extrapolating these feelings from a person whose relationship status you don't even know.

It doesn't seem like she wants to be just friends.

That's what you think. You think that she owes you anything because she acted nice toward you.

Ok, fine. What's the second scenario?

She's not in a relationship, but she just wants to be friends. You're assuming that she's even interested in you at all and that she owes you her feelings after you had a conversation.

I felt that there was something there.

Oh my god. You felt that there was something there. You know nothing about how she feels, and you're mistaking your own emotions for hers.

What if she actually likes me though?

Then great! That brings me to the third scenario: everything works out. But people don't fall in love after one conversation. Since you're entertaining this scenario, you're harming a potential genuine friendship.

What do I do then? Just ignore all the signs?

There are no signs. You're entering these scenarios thinking that any interaction with a girl is a romantic interaction because you're viewing them as something to be desired.

Is it wrong for me to like her?

No, not at all. But when you let those feelings influence your relationship, you're being extremely selfish. Don't throw away a friendship because you couldn't control your own emotions.

Why am I like this?

It's okay. Just don't enter relationships with people expecting anything back. Your job is to solely give. Show them genuine care. If something happens, let it happen because you showed them your genuine self.

Do you think the friendzone exists?

No. It never did. People just expect romantic relationships as a reward for being a normal person. Don't make the same mistake.

I wish someone would've told me this so much earlier.

I do too. But we learn.
