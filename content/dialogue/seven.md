# Seven

What do you think happens after we die?

*You're asking a really big question.*

I mean, there are religious, spiritual, and personal beliefs behind it. It's a pretty good icebreaker, no?

*Normally, people talk about themselves on the first date.*

You are talking about yourself though! What you think is beyond death is a very important part of your identity, trust me.

*You seem unreasonably lighthearted and enthusiastic about this topic. You've asked this question to a lot of people, haven't you?*

Of course! It tells me a lot about what you value in life. It's like astrology and horoscopes to me.

*Oh, so you're gonna tell me how it leads to all of my life problems?*

C'mon, stop beating around the bush. How about I pay the bill after you give me your answer?

*Deal. Okay, so, you know how our brains explode in activity a couple of minutes after we die?*

Yeah. It's like the brain's last stand.

*Right, so assume that we're still conscious in this moment. What do you think our brain makes us see?*

Probably our most valuable memories, similar to a montage of the best moments of our life. It's like that phrase, "life flashing before your eyes."

*But that phrase is for near-death experiences, so what about the actual experience of death?*

Seems like you've thought about this a good amount. What do you think happens?

*I call it the 7-minute theory. In the seven minutes that your brain is extremely active, your brain creates a new reality.*

A new reality? Like a dream?

*Exactly. But since time works differently in a dream, your new reality feels a lot longer than seven minutes, so it feels like the afterlife.*

Then what? What's the new reality?

*Whatever you believe in. If you believe in the afterlife, you go to Heaven or some other higher place. If you believe in reincarnation, you are reborn in the reality. Whatever you think happens after death happens.*

So what about right now? Are we actually dead?

*Well, I think that my past life believed in reincarnation. So, in those seven minutes, my past brain created this reality that I now live in. My reality created you and this weird restaurant we're in.*

Hey, don't be hating on ramen tacos; they're the future, trust me. Anyway, aren't you just describing solipsism?

*I guess I am. But isn't that so beautiful?*

What is?

*Life.* Everything *we perceive is handcrafted by a brain that reconstructed reality down to the smallest detail.*

So is any of this real? Do I even exist?

*Yes. All of this is real because we believe it to be real. Our reality doesn't change because of my belief in this 7-minute theory. It's just comforting to me that our reality was meticulously created so we could live.*

That is definitely the most interesting response I've ever received.

*You asked for it.*

Fair. But I didn't expect to receive an explanation of our entire reality as we know it.

*Well, doesn't it feel nice to know that something, somewhere, created this just for you and me?*

That sounds borderline religious.

*I guess I get the appeal of religions then.*

So, if I'm not real, and you're not real, and this reality we live in is fabricated by some brain, then what do we have to lose?

*Nothing.*

Ok, then do you wanna go on a second date?

*I'd love to.*
