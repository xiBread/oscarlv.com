# Ready

Why are you avoiding me?

*I don't know.*

Look me in the eyes, and tell me why.

*Can I please just leave?*

If you leave, you'll never see me again.

*I'm fine with that. Let me go.*

Are you kidding me? After everything? All the nights we spent talking, all the gifts that we exchanged, and you just want to act like it didn't matter at all?

*I don't know what you're trying to get out of me.*

I'm trying to get something, *anything*, out of you. Did I not matter to you at all? Did you just want to lead me on?

*You want the answer? I never liked you. You just started talking to me, and I just went along with it.*

Both of us know that's bullshit.

*It's the truth, whether you like it or not.*

God, what don't you get? I like you! I have feelings for you! I want to spend more time with you, but you've just disappeared for no reason!

*â€¦I know.*

You know? Is that why you distance yourself? You're scared of me confessing my feelings to you?

*I just didn't want you to be hurt by me.*

Oh, so you were just gonna reject me preemptively and disappear to "protect" me?

*Please, just let me go.*

No. We're going to talk about this because you can't just leave people's lives like this.

*I already told you everything there is to know. I never liked you.*

No, I think I know what's going on. You're scared of developing feelings too, so you ditched everything. What's so wrong with reciprocating my feelings? Are you scared to like me?

*It's not you. You weren't the reason I was avoiding you. Is that what you wanted to hear?*

Oh, come on, don't give me that "it's not you, it's me" rhetoric. What's *actually* the reason? You think you don't deserve love? Are you scared of falling in love?

*Yes! I'm terrified of falling in love. You know me better than anyone else. You* know *that I'm not ready to be loved.*

Why are you so scared?

*One day, you'll realize you don't actually love me. You'll fall out of love. What am I supposed to do, then?*

So because you think that a relationship with me would crash and burn, you'd rather disappear from my life forever?

*Neither of us would get hurt. That's the best-case scenario.*

You already hurt me. Why didn't you just talk to me? Why didn't you just say that you didn't want to be in a relationship?

*Because I knew as soon as we started talking, we'd end up in a relationship. I can't refuse you.*

Why would I convince you to be in a relationship when you aren't ready for one?

*You wouldn't have to do anything to convince me. Just seeing you would make me feel okay with falling in love with you.*

Then I'll wait. I'll wait until you're completely ready.

*What if I'm never ready?*

That's okay too. Please just tell me you'll try.

*I'll try.*

I'm okay with my heart being broken as long as it's you who does it.

*Then I'll try my best not to break it.*
