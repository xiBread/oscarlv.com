## Earring Set with Patina

The earring set explores geometric design with a focus on shape and balance. The inspiration for this project came from the artwork of Piet Mondrian, particularly his use of black lines and squares in his compositions. I aimed to create a similar effect by subtracting the middle of each square and using a black patina on copper sheets. This project introduced me to cutting, filing, sanding, and applying a patina to metal. After completing each component, I assembled the earrings using jump rings and copper wire for the hooks. The end result is a striking and minimalist statement piece.

## Themed Ring and Pendant

My pendant and ring explore the theme of photography. The inspiration for this project came from my love for photography and honoring its origins. The pendant is designed to resemble a vintage camera, with intricate details such as the lens and the flash. To create a sense of unity, the ring is inspired by a film reel and features a black patina finish to mimic the look of exposed film. This project introduced me to soldering, forming, and polishing metal. The result is a unique and meaningful jewelry set for any photography enthusiast.

## Architectural Ring

The architectural ring project focuses on vertical urbanism. The inspiration for this project came from the unique design of the Shanghai Tower, with its twisting and tapering form. To bring this design to life, I first carved the shape of the ring out of wax, paying close attention to the intricate details of the tower's architecture, such as its lines. Then, the wax ring was cast in sterling silver using the lost wax casting process. Molten metal was carefully poured into the mold and then quenched, allowing it to cool and solidify. The result is a stunning piece of jewelry that captures the spirit of the Shanghai Tower in a wearable form.

## Art Nouveau Keychain

My keychain features an organic design with vibrant colors inspired by the Art Nouveau movement. The top layer of the keychain has a rose's petals, leaves, and stem carved out to create a delicate and romantic feel. The bottom layer was then soldered together so I could inlay the top with colored resin. Nickel was chosen as the metal because of its neutral color, emphasizing the color. The result is a beautiful and unique keychain that celebrates the beauty of Art Nouveau. This was my favorite project because of the layering and amount of metal I had to work with.
