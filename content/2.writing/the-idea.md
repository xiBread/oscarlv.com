# The Idea

*I'm sorry.*

I still don't understand why you want to break up.

*You love the* idea *of me. Not the actual me.*

What?

*Why are you always the priority in this relationship? Why are both of us putting you first? It's reached the point where I'm self-conscious whenever I talk to you. I shouldn't constantly be questioning whether I'm a needy person.*

Why didn't I know about this sooner? You're always the one saying that communication is key.

*It is. But communication isn't shit without comprehension.* Your *comprehension.*

You're starting to make me feel stupid. Whenever you bring us up, I never know what to say or do. Don't I tell you I love you all the time? Don't I show you off to all my loved ones? I don't understand why I'm not good enough. Why are you trying to change something that we both assumed was perfect?

*It obviously isn't perfect if we're having this conversation.*

But isn't love enough to&mdash;

*No. Don't pull that bullshit excuse again. Love is not enough to make a relationship work. I can barely squeeze a word in whenever I'm with you and other people. You always do all the talking, even when telling a story involving me. I can't interject either because it always ends in a fight about how I was being "rude" in front of them.*

But&mdash;

*I'm going to ask you a question. I don't even care if you're honest with me; just be honest with yourself.*

Ok&mldr;

*Are you actually in love with me, or do you just love the idea of a trophy partner?*

"Trophy partner" is a pretty cynical way to put it, don't you think?

I don't know what you're expecting me to say.

*Sounds like an answer to me.*

I just don't understand why you're so hung up on whether I love you. Am I not doing enough to prove that? Should I get on a rooftop and profess it like I'm in a Shakespeare play?

*Just&mdash;*

God, I am *so* in LOVE with you! I can barely feel my face from the butterflies I'm getting from talking to you right now!

*Jesus, shut up.*

The sight of your glorious face makes me physically melt. A night full of stars could *never* compare to&mdash;

*Can you shut the fuck up?!*

*I'm sorry.*

I just hate fighting with you.

*I hate fighting with you too.*

*It's the pressure of having to say it back.*

Huh?

*That's my answer to your question. You're just always soâ€¦ comfortable when you say it. You look like you feel safe whenever you say, "I love you." It makes me feel guilty if I don't say it because I'll hurt you. So I say it.*

Oh.

Then I think I understand what you meant by the "idea of you."

*You think so?*

I'm not saying "I love you" to you who says it in return. I'm saying "I love you" to some echo chamber of myself.

*Huh. You actually got it.*
