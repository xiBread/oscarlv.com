# Maybe

maybe i fell in love\
because your favorite color was blue,\
like mine.\
maybe i fell in love\
with the way you would talk to me\
all night on the phone.\
maybe i fell in love\
with all the pinky promises you made me.\
maybe i fell in love with the idea\
of you falling into\
my glassy blue eyes.\
maybe i fell in love with the idea\
that those phone calls would turn into\
being with me all the time.\
maybe i fell in love with the idea\
that picking out your outfits\
would turn into picking a name\
for our future pet.\
maybe i fell in love with the idea\
of our big\
beautiful\
life one day\
together.\
but the part that scares me\
is that none of these came true.\
maybe you were just an idea.
