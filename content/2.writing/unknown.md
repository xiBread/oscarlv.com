# Unknown

love is so bittersweet.\
you never know what i'm thinking about you.\
little do you know the way i look at you.\
i see you when you're not looking at me.\
i look at you and smile when you don't notice.\
when you're on your phone,\
i can't help but to break out\
in a grin.\
the way you are so concentrated\
on the little screen in front of your face,\
or when you're doing something you love\
and i get to watch your eyes light up with joy,\
or when you're sipping on a root beer float\
in our favorite restaurant,\
hoping the waiter will bring you another,\
while i'm hoping you never get up from this booth.\
the way your hair is slicked back when you get out of the shower,\
or the way you look so peaceful when you sleep.\
when you laugh at a joke in a movie\
and i see your shy, delicate smile appear.\
all of these scenarios seem to be\
dramatically different from one another,\
yet one thing stays constant in all of them.\
when i looked at you in each of these moments,\
my world slowed.\
all i could see was you,\
and everything else was in slow motion.\
nothing else mattered,\
and the funny thing about it\
is that you'll never know how much i look at you,\
or how perfect i see you.\
you'll never know how much i love you.
