# i hope i haunt u

there's no nice way to put this\
there's no romantic perspective to this\
but i hope i haunt u

i hope my last words sting u\
and i hope u kiss someone else\
and think about how badly\
u messed up with me\
i hope u think of me\
i hope u regret\
giving me up\
i hope u hug someone else\
and i hope it feels 10 degrees colder\
than my hugs did\
i hope u lay in bed at night\
and beg the universe\
for a second chance with me\
i hope u regret the pain\
u put me thru\
i hope u regret not being\
sure about me\
i hope u find yourself\
wishing u would've done things differently\
i hope u regret\
letting me walk away\
i hope u regret\
every\
last\
thing\
that you ever did to me\
for the rest of forever

i hope i haunt u\
the way\
u haunt me
