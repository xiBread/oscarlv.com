# Friends?

You said I could have all of you\
or absolutely none\
and so\
we don't stay friends\
or keep in touch,\
but just quietly learn how to fall out of love.\
And I respect the way you let me go with such\
finality&mdash;\
no second thoughts\
or midnight calls,\
just scissors cutting through strings.\
For a moment, it feels cruel,\
but it's the kindest thing we can do.

You don't text to ask if I made it home safe&mdash;\
that's not your role to play as of 11:58&mdash;\
and so the process of detangling ourselves from each other\
begins.\
I cry as I cross off your favorite brand of coffee\
from my shopping list.\
What starts as these frequent stabs of pain\
then evolves to a dull and gentle ache,\
like when a mutual friend mentions your name\
or I hear a lyric I know you'd hate.

Somehow, staying over here is how I show\
I care for you,\
and you giving me all this space is how\
I know\
you care for me, too.
