# Tuesday

It's a Tuesday, and I'm tired,\
So I asked if you could hold me.\
You said, "Sure."\
It's a Tuesday, and I'm tired,\
So I crumpled into your arms\
And I let my lungs breathe with yours.\
I gave you my heart on a tired Tuesday,\
Much like I would on a tired Wednesday,\
Much like I would give you my soul to soothe\
In a tired Tuesday-like life\
Where I can't bother to babysit it anymore.\
It's a Tuesday, and I'm tired:\
I'm sorry I made it your problem.\
It's a Tuesday, and I'm tired,\
And you're tired,\
And I just want to hold you.\
How many people love me?\
My heart asked frequently.\
I don't know, but I bet I could count them\
On my hands and on yours,\
So let's put our palms together\
And intertwine our fingers\
To check.\
It's a Tuesday, and we're tired,\
And I love you more than anything right now\
So wait to close your eyes until tomorrow.
