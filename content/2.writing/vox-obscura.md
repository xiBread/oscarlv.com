# Vox Obscura

> How can I visualize subtleties of the human experience that have no language?

The goal of *Vox Obscura* (literally *dark voice*; figuratively *a/the voice in the dark*) is to shine a light on the fundamental strangeness of being a human&mdash;all the unknowns, urges, highs and lows, and aesthetics that are humming in the background of everyday life. I want to explore the serenity felt when learning that others share the same experiences and focus on that moment of clarity.

## Nocturnal

*Nocturnal* depicts the comforting solitude felt by being the only person awake during the middle of the night.

I used photography as my medium because a camera is able to take a snapshot of time, reinforcing the idea that there's a brief window where clarity hits. I experimented heavily with lighting because of how much it can be manipulated in a dark setting. In post-processing, I explored different filters and overlays, levels of contrast, and grain to see if they would add to the overall mood. Ultimately, I decided to have a clear figure with warm lighting to evoke comfort and calmness.

## Duality

*Duality* represents the secluded solace of hotel rooms&mdash;existing as a state suspended halfway between occupied and vacant. It illustrates the temporary relief from the routine of life&mdash;chores, family, work, and other mundane distractions.

To effectively portray this paradoxical condition, I left the room as it was when I walked in. The only adjustment made is an open suitcase with a couple of articles of clothing sitting on the bed to capture the moment that exists during arrival and departure.
