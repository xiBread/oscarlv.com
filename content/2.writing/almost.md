# Almost

I almost wish we'd never met.\
*Almost*.\
I still see in you what you failed to see in me;\
What you almost saw in me.

I almost wish we'd never talked.\
*Almost*.\
I still think about what was said,\
And promises that were almost kept.

I almost wish I'd never loved you.\
*Almost*.\
I still do, in case you were wondering,\
And the fact that you almost loved me too.

And I almost wish you'd never left.\
*Almost*.\
I still wish you'd come back,\
But I've almost healed from the damage you left.
