# Severance

It's funny how willing you are\
to tear down the walls\
that you've spent years\
building\
in an instant\
for just\
one\
single\
person.

I can't blame myself, though.\
I wanted to feel seen for once.

I hated myself\
for allowing such a vulnerable part of me\
be open to you.\
I felt sorry for myself.

But then I realized\
I shouldn't be sorry\
for loving someone.

And I'm not.\
I'm not sorry.\
I'm not sorry\
for loving you,\
for being a person that cared,\
for asking about how your day was\
and showering you with compliments.

I *am* sorry that we didn't make it.

But as much as I want you back in my life,\
I can't put myself through that.\
I can't keep reaching out to someone\
who doesn't care anymore.

If you're meant to come back,\
you'll come back.\
If you're not meant to be,\
I'll have to say goodbye at some point,\
and soon,\
we'll go our separate paths,\
and I'll move on eventually,\
slowly but surely.

It's scary to let go;\
to let *you* go.\
But I know that I have to\
because deep down,\
I know\
you're gone.
