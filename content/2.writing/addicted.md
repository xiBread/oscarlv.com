# Addicted

i always wondered,\
and still to this day wonder,\
why you?

what made you so damn special?\
what made my heart skip a beat each time i saw you?\
what made my eyes glue to you in a room full of people?\
what drew my heart closer to yours than to anyone else's?\
why did everyone else become\
"everyone else"\
the second i met you?

i don't know what it was about you,\
but that one thing about you\
is somewhere lost in the stars,\
and it won't exist within anyone else.\
i became addicted to you.\
you became my drug.\
i miss that drug.
